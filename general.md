# general documentation for company example

## Onboarding

You have somebody new in your company and they want to start working.
They can either be in your team, so they need a very detail explanation of
the pieces of software the team is using. When they are not in your team,
they may only need a high level overview what your team is doing.

In both cases they need to setup their environment first before they
can start any work. This installation requires in general 3 steps:

* Pre Installation
* Installation
* Post Installation

### Pre Installation

This section describe topics that need to be done before you can install anything. For example, how you get the hardware, credentials for login.

### Installation

Here you define the actual installation steps.

    Hint: Build a Dockerfile that tests your installation steps.

### Post Installation

Some tasks can not be done in an automatic fashion. You may need to enter
user specific credentials or even generate something by yourself.
This steps should be written in this area.

- Codestyle
- IDE Settings (Memory?)

# Team Documentation

After you have your applications up and running, you can start to write
documentation about topics that are related to *you* or *your team*.

In general we can't remember everything, especially when some time passes.
Writing a team documentation can be helpful for you as well - you can be
the one that forgot how to do something and look it up again.

## Snippets

A Team Documentation can also have different levels of granularity.
The first one are `snippets` - its a chunk of program that is used quite
often but is not easy to remember.
