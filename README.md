# documentation-templates

    Not many people like to write documentation. But I think good
    documentation is one of the keys to success for any project.

This repository contains several documentation templates that you can
use for your own projects or your company. You may not need every
aspect of the templates, but they give you an idea what *can* be
documented in your projects.

This README.md glues everything together, as meta documentation for
the documentation templates.

TL;DR: Use `general.md` for documenting general topics and `repository.md`
as repository / project specific documentation. Feel free to rename `repository.md` to `README.md` in your repository.

# How is your audience that you want to address?

This is the first question you have to answer. I thought of three different
target audiences. Each of them have a different demand in the granularity of
the documentation and have a different focus. They are:
* Team
* Company
* External Partners


    Good documentation reflect any granularity of your project.

Some documentation can be done in one place for all projects.
Other documentation should in the README.md of the appropriate repository.
The rule of thumb: Is this information relevant only for a specific project,
or is in general enough to put it in a general documentation.

"But I don't need everything" - that is totally fine. Just skip it and write "skipped". Maybe in the future you will add documentation their.

# general.md
This is a template to documenting topics that are imo project independent. Its enough to document them once.

# repository.md
This template should be copied to every repository your team is responsible of end filled accordingly with the required information.

# Final Words
Documentation have to be taken care. Update it as often as possible.
